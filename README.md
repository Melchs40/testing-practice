# testing-practice

The purpose of this project is to better understanding how test driven development works and the usefulness of using TDD within your code. By being able to use TDD in my projects, I will be able to better discover where my code is failing and solve those issues quicker than before. This will allow for me to spend less time trying to figure out where exactly my code is lacking and get on with actually producing functional code.
